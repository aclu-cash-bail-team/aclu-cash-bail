# ACLU Cash Bail Visualization Repository

This repository hosts the visualization code for the ACLU PA Cash Bail Report.

## Dev Environment Setup

We're using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) to bundle resources. For development, run `npm run dev` to build and watch the CSS and JS. Then run `parcel index.html` in another terminal tab, and it will serve the app at `localhost:1234`. (You may need to run `npx parcel index.html` if the first command doesn't work. Alternatively, run `npm install -g parcel-bundler`, and the first command should work.)

## Webflow Integration
Though the visualization code is hosted here, it will actually be deployed on the ACLU site.
The code will be served using the [JSDelivr CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) directly from this Github repo
